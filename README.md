## Executive Summary  

In this project, I develop a **scalable credit risk framework** for GEâ€™s credit team, following the **CRISP-DM methodology**. It consolidates three milestones into a cohesive solution:

1. **Business Case & Ethics Review** â€“ Assessed Excel-based credit evaluation, identified risks of bias in sensitive fields (gender, race, marital status), and proposed an ethical strategy aligned with fair lending laws.  
2. **Pilot Predictive Model (k-NN)** â€“ Built in R to classify loan applicants using historical data; tested with Age and Na/K ratio features to validate feasibility.  
3. **Final Deployment Plan** â€“ Outlined integration with SQL + Power BI for scalability, real-time dashboards, and automation to reduce manual workload.  

**Business Impact:**  
- Potential to reduce loan default losses by **15%+ annually**.  
- Automates applicant vetting, cutting turnaround time by **30â€“40%**.  
- Strengthens compliance by excluding sensitive variables and embedding continuous monitoring.  

This project demonstrates strengths in **predictive modeling (k-NN, logistic regression, decision trees)**, **data preparation in R**, and **business translation**, while highlighting the ethical considerations of deploying AI in financial services.

## Business Context  

- **Problem**: GEâ€™s Excel-based credit evaluation lacked scalability and predictive power.  
- **Data**: 1,000 applicants Ã— 31 features (salary, credit history, loan amount, etc.).  
- **Goal**: Build a **scalable, predictive solution** to reduce loan default losses and improve decision-making.  
- **Business Value**:  
  - Prevented loan default losses â†’ up to **15% annual reduction**.  
  - Improved turnaround â†’ **30â€“40% faster evaluations**.  
  - Automated workflows â†’ reduced manual workload, enabling staff to focus on strategy.

## CRISP-DM Workflow  

1. **Business Understanding**  
   - Need for scalable, fair, and transparent risk modeling post-2008 crisis.  
2. **Data Understanding**  
   - 31 applicant variables including demographics, credit history, and loan amount.  
3. **Data Preparation**  
   - Cleaning, imputation, feature scaling (Z-score standardization).  
   - Ethical filtering â†’ excluded gender, race, and marital status.  
4. **Modeling**  
   - k-NN pilot with Age + Na/K ratio.  
   - Compared to logistic regression & decision trees.  
5. **Evaluation**  
   - Confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and interpretability checks.  
   - k-NN chosen for transparency in compliance-heavy environments.  
6. **Deployment**  
   - Proposed SQL integration + Power BI dashboards for **real-time loan risk scoring**.

## Methods  

- **Algorithm**: k-NN (Euclidean distance, tested multiple k values).  
- **Tools**:  
  - **R** â†’ Data prep, modeling, evaluation.  
  - **SQL** â†’ Integration with GEâ€™s Oracle warehouse.  
  - **Power BI** â†’ Dashboards for stakeholder reporting.  
- **Ethics**: Removed sensitive fields, monitored compliance with **Equal Credit Opportunity Act**.  

---

## Results & Insights  

- **Pilot k-NN** successfully classified new applicants â†’ transparent and explainable.  
- **Validation** with distance matrices confirmed interpretability.  
- **Scaling potential**: Automating evaluation across 10,000+ annual applications.  
- **Expected ROI**: Hundreds of thousands saved annually from reduced defaults + operational efficiency.

## Key Skills Demonstrated  

- Applied **CRISP-DM methodology** end-to-end.  
- **Predictive modeling** with k-NN, logistic regression, decision trees.  
- **Ethics in analytics**: Fair lending compliance, bias detection, and variable selection.  
- **Business translation**: Linking technical outputs to ROI, compliance, and efficiency gains.  
- **Data prep best practices**: Cleaning, feature scaling, reproducibility in R.  
- **Visualization & reporting**: Proposed BI dashboards for executives.

## Limitations & Next Steps  

- Small pilot dataset â†’ expand with income, credit history, debt-to-income ratio.  
- Class imbalance â†’ explore **SMOTE** or cost-sensitive learning.  
- Add **hyperparameter tuning** (grid search, Bayesian optimization).  
- Deploy models with **PMML** for integration into CRM systems.  
- Pilot test with full GE customer dataset before large-scale rollout.
